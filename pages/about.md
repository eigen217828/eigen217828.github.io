## Who am I?

  I study and adapt AI algorithms particularly in spatial domain.
  I wish someday I could create special one for artificial general intelligence(AGI) and spatial perception.

  I believe the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is the key to spatial perception, and I'm deeply interested in its application within the AI area.

  I majored in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) at Yonsei University, Republic of South Korea.
  From there, I learned broad knowledge about mathematics, physics, AI, and their applications such as computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), electronic engineering, and mechanical engineering.

  I was a research intern at Seoul National University (SNU) focusing on biomedical AI and at Yonsei University focusing on AI applications.
